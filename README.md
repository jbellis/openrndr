## Using OPENRNDR

You are adivsed to use the [OPENRNDR template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template) which provides a quick start to using the library.

## Building OPENRNDR

On a system that has JDK 1.8.x or more recent installed one can run the following commands from a terminal:

```sh
cd <path-to-checkout>
./gradlew build
```

This should start the build process, which will take some time to complete.

Note that OPENRNDR does not depend on anything that is not on Maven Central, builds should be easy and predictable.

## Installing OPENRNDR as Maven artifacts

In order to use the OPENRNDR build from your applications one has to install OPENRNDR's Maven artifacts in the local Maven repository.

```sh
./gradlew -Prelease.version=0.4.0-SNAPSHOT publishToMavenLocal
```

## Building OPENRNDR from IntelliJ

This should be as easy as importing the Gradle project into IntelliJ.

On a macOS or linux system that has IntelliJ's command line tools installed one can run

```sh
cd <path-to-checkout>
idea .
```
